            The next morning she was asked how she had slept. "Oh, very well indeed!" She replied. 
            All the beds made for the most comfortable nights rest possible.
            Everything was as perfect as possible. 
            </p>
           <p>
               
           It was clear. The Lady was another lost cause. I don't know why but it seems 
            that no ones a real princess. I have searched and searched yet I can't find anyone
            delecate enough to feel the peas.

            The man continued to search for his ideal princess in his ridiclous ways. 
            Yet he never seemed to relize that something so simple and so random 
            can never find him a true princess. For that that makes one a princess lies in there heart.
